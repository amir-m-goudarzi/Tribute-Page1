        Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 â€“ October 5, 2011) was an American
        businessman, inventor, and investor best known for co-founding the
        technology company Apple Inc. Jobs was also the founder of NeXT and
        chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar.<br />
        He was a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and
        1980s, along with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder
        Steve Wozniak. Jobs was born in San Francisco in 1955 and adopted
        shortly afterwards. He attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing
        that same year. In 1974, he traveled through India, seeking
        enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism.<br />
        He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to further develop and sell
        Wozniak's Apple I personal computer.<br />
        Together, the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with production
        and sale of the Apple II, one of the first highly successful
        mass-produced microcomputers. Jobs saw the commercial potential of the
        Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user
        interface (GUI).<br />
        This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983,
        followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced
        computer with a GUI. The Macintosh launched the desktop publishing
        industry in 1985 (for example, the Aldus Pagemaker) with the addition of
        the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector
        graphics and PostScript.<br />
        In 1985, Jobs departed Apple after a long power struggle with the
        company's board and its then-CEO, John Sculley. That same year, Jobs
        took some Apple employees with him to found NeXT, a computer platform
        development company that specialized in computers for higher-education
        and business markets, serving as its CEO. In 1986, he helped develop the
        visual effects industry by funding the computer graphics division of
        Lucasfilm that eventually spun off independently as Pixar, which
        produced the first 3D computer-animated feature film Toy Story (1995)
        and became a leading animation studio, producing 28 films since. In
        1997, Jobs returned to Apple as CEO after the company's acquisition of
        NeXT. He was largely responsible for reviving Apple, which was on the
        verge of bankruptcy.<br />
        He worked closely with British designer Jony Ive to develop a line of
        products and services that had larger cultural ramifications, beginning
        with the "Think different" advertising campaign, and leading to the
        iMac, iTunes, Mac OS X, Apple Store, iPod, iTunes Store, iPhone, App
        Store, and iPad. In 2003, Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic
        neuroendocrine tumor. He died of tumor-related respiratory arrest in
        2011; in 2022, he was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of
        Freedom.
